TD-Tool
W. Scott Meador

Requires Python 2.6 and wxPython


The start of a larger project that supports different tools needed by Technical Directors (TD) and content creation artists.

It is currently in four parts:

Panel 1 - Project Creator: Creates a directory structure to start a project.

TODO: Create some code to sort the tree alphabetically.

Panel 2 - Rsync frontend. Very simple.

TODO: Bundle rsync 3 with OSX patches to better support resource forks in HFS+ extended. OR, suggest that the user install it and add an option to put in its path.

Panel 3 - Sequence Renamer: Rename a directory of files. Useful for multiple images from a camera or 3D rendering.

Needs more use to find bugs

Panel 4 - Blender Render Queue: Sets up a queue of blend files to render on one computer

Needs more use to find bugs
