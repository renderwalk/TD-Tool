TD-Tool
W. Scott Meador

Requires Python 2.6 and wxPython. Developed on OSX 10.5,10.6. Tested on Linux. Assume it will need some path re-coding to work on Windows "/" vs "\\".


It is the start of a larger project that supports different tools needed by Technical Directors (TD) and content creation artists. Would like to port the GUI to QT via pyQT or pySide.

It is currently in four parts:

Panel 1 - Project Creator: Creates a directory structure to start a project.

TODO: Create some code to sort the tree alphabetically.

Panel 2 - Rsync frontend. Very simple.

TODO: Bundle rsync 3 with OSX patches to better support resource forks in HFS+ extended. OR, suggest that the user install it and add an option to put in its path.

Panel 3 - Sequence Renamer: Rename a directory of files. Useful for multiple images from a camera or 3D rendering.

Needs more use to find bugs

Panel 4 - Blender Render Queue: Sets up a queue of blend files to render on one computer

Needs more use to find bugs
